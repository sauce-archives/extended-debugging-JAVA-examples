## Java-Cucumber-Junit

### Environment Setup

1. Global Dependencies
    * Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
    * Or Install Maven with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (Easier)
    ```
    $ brew install maven
    ```
2. Sauce Labs Credentials
    * In the terminal, export your Sauce Labs credentials as environmental variables:
    ```
    $ export SAUCE_USERNAME=<your Sauce Labs username>
    $ export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<your Sauce Labs access key>
    ```
3. Project Dependencies
    * Check that packages are available
    ```
    $ cd Java-CucumberJVM-JUnit
    $ mvn test-compile
    ```
    * You may also want to run the command below to check for outdated dependencies. Please be sure to verify and review updates before editing your pom.xml file as they may not be compatible with your code.
    ```
    $ mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
    ```
    
### Running the tests
```
$ make test
```

### Test Performance Regression

In demo app, we have `performance_glitch_user` user to test performance regression. By using this user PageLoad time will be increased by 5s and existing test case will be failed.

```
$ PERF_USERNAME=performance_glitch_user make run_all_in_parallel
```

### Advice/Troubleshooting
1. It may be useful to use a Java IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse to help troubleshoot potential issues. 
2. There may be additional latency when using a remote webdriver to run tests on Sauce Labs. Timeouts and/or waits may need to be increased.
